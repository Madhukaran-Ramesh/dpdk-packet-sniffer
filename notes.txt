Initialization:

The DPDK environment is initialized using rte_eal_init.
A memory pool for packet buffers is created using rte_pktmbuf_pool_create.
Port Configuration:

The Ethernet port is configured using rte_eth_dev_configure.
RX queues are set up using rte_eth_rx_queue_setup.
The port is started with rte_eth_dev_start, and promiscuous mode is enabled.
Packet Capture Loop:

Packets are captured in bursts using rte_eth_rx_burst.
Each packet's length is printed, and the packet buffer is freed using rte_pktmbuf_free.
Cleanup:

The Ethernet port is stopped and closed, and DPDK resources are cleaned up (though this part is unreachable in the infinite loop).
